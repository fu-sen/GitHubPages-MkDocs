# GitHubPages-MkDocs

**MkDocs with GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions (minimal configuration)**

<https://github.com/fu-sen/GitHubPages-MkDocs>

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)

MkDocs has a `mkdocs gh-deploy` command, but using this method you can publish the original source to the repository instead of the built HTML. You commit instead of the MkDocs command.
